### User Story 1

You are the new web developer for Westeros. The IT staff has provided an API where you can get a listing of house members.

Documentation: `https://westerosapi.herokuapp.com/`

You are to create an app and complete this following user story:

```
As a user
When I visit "/"
And I select "Greyjoy" from the dropdown
And I click on "Get Members"
Then my path should be "/search" with "house=greyjoy" in the parameters
And I should see a message "7 Members"
And I should see a list of the 7 members of House Greyjoy
And I should see a name and id for each member.
```

### User Story 2

Bad news. It looks like all of the Westeros IT staff have been poisoned. We are going to have to switch APIs.

We are now customers of Westeros As A Service
